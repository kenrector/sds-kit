# SDS Software Kit
This is a collection of software for use with the simh SDS simulator.  It is provided in hopes of
exciting the interested of those curious about computing during
the 1960-1976 period.

## Introduction
The SDS 900 Series computers supported paper tape and card unit record
systems and the software in this kit predominatly uses these devices.

Included are a cross assembler used on a Mac to produce the included
Symbol assembler and tools to help manage and
manipulate this stuff; things like a binary object dump, a namelist
program and a program to retieve files from a PAL library file.

The SDS programs in the kit are files copied from a
9-track tape that was created by the SDS PAL library back in 1982.
This file is from the bitsaver.org archives, M300-19820128.tap.

The SDS basic paper tape loader program, 850644, is included in the kit as 
an example to experiment with the SDS recon and Symbol assembler 
programs.  The work to put this kit together was done on a Mac.  I don't know what 
will happen using this stuff on other platforms
