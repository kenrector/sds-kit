940-mt.si  was copied from examples in the 930 and 940 reference manuals.
The 940 example has a bug where the connect EOM is in the output loop instead of
before it.  The 930 example has a bug where the connect EOM doesn't select the
interlace.  Fixing these makes the example run fine on the 940 simulator.
