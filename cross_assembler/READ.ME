This is a cross assmbler to mimic the SDS Symbol Assembler on a mac.

It was developed to assemble the SDS Symbol assembler from source
code listings found in the Symbol Tech Manual dated March 1965,
catalog number 900688A.  It serves its purpose but is missing some
features that weren't needed at the time.  I hope it may be useful.

The bld_xsym.sh is the simple gcc command to compile and link the
files.
